            <section id="Biography">
                <h2>Her Personal Life</h2>
                <p>Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born near Concordia, Missouri, to German-American parents, Joseph Adolph Kuhlman and Emma Walkenhorst. Several years after a spiritual experience at age 14, she began itinerant preaching with her elder sister and brother-in law in Idaho. Later, she was ordained by the Evangelical Church Alliance.</p>
                <h2>Her Ministry</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kuhlman traveled extensively around the United States and in many other countries holding "healing crusades" between the 1940s and 1970s.</li> 
                        <li>She was one of the most well-known healing ministers in the world.</li>
                        <li>Kuhlman had a weekly TV program in the 1960s and 1970s called I Believe In Miracles that was aired nationally. She also had a 30-minute nationwide radio ministry of teaching from the Bible and frequently would feature excerpts from her healing services (both music and message).</li>
                        <li>She had a foundation which was established in 1954</li>
                        <li>By 1970 she moved to Los Angeles, conducting healing services for thousands of people, and was often compared to Aimee Semple MacPherson.</li>
                        <li>She became well known for her "gift of healing" despite, as she often noted, having no theological training</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>The Miracles</h2>
                <p>
                    An estimated two million people reported they were healed in her meetings over the years.
                    Dr. Richard Owellen, a member of the cancer-research department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who appeared frequently at Miss Kuhlman's services, testified to various healings that he said he had investigated
